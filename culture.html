    <h3>Festivals </h3>
    <p>Kyoto is well known for its traditional festivals which have been held for over 1,000 years and are a major tourist attraction. The first is the Aoi Matsuri on May 15. Two months later is the Gion Matsuri known as one of the 3 great festivals of Japan, culminating in a massive parade on July 17. Kyoto marks the Bon Festival with the Gozan no Okuribi, lighting fires on mountains to guide the spirits home. The October 22 Jidai Matsuri, Festival of the Ages, celebrates Kyoto's illustrious past.</p>
